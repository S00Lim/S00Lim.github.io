            O Me! O life! of the questions of these recurring,<br>
            Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill’d with the foolish,<br>
            Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?)<br>
            Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew’d,<br>
            Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me,<br>
            Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined,<br>
            The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good amid these, O me, O life?
