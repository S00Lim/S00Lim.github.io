(sound)
<p>
O Me! O life! of the questions of these recurring, </p>

<p>
Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill’d with the foolish, </p>
<p>
Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?) </p>
<p>
Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew’d, </p>
<p>
Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me, </p>
<p>
Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined, </p>
<p>
The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good amid these, O me, O life? </p>
